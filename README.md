# Storyteller
_A library for working with user output_

## Introduction

This library is intended to be used by tools, such as cli's, which have multiple user interface
options through which they can communicate, while also having various separate commands (or
flows) which require each to carefully specify their own output formatting.

The library consists of three primary building blocks, and a default implementation on top
of these building blocks.

The three building blocks are:
* `EventHandler`: The event handler receives an event (our message type) as input,
    and decides what to do with this message. Examples include a json-lines handler which
    prints events to to stderr, a progress bar, a faked handler which collects events for
    which may be asserted on in software tests, or a handler which sends websocket messages
    for each event.
    
* `Reporter`: Used to communicate messages to a user. The reporter is invoked with an Event within the code base, so you don't have to deal with formatting and display details in the middle of the program flow.

* `EventListener`: Receives the messages, send by a reporter and runs the `EventHandler`
    where appropriate.

On top of these building blocks, a channel based implementation is provided which runs the `EventHandler`
in a separate thread. To use this implementation, consult the docs for the `crate::ChannelReporter`, and the
`ChannelEventListener`.

## Example

```rust
use std::io::{Stderr, Write};
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::time::Duration;
use std::{io, thread};
use storyteller::{
    disconnect_channel, event_channel, ChannelEventListener, ChannelReporter, EventHandler,
    EventListener, Reporter,
};

// See the test function `bar` in src/tests.rs for an example where the handler is a progress bar.
fn main() {
    let (sender, receiver) = event_channel::<ExampleEvent>();
    let (disconnect_sender, disconnect_receiver) = disconnect_channel();

    // Handlers are implemented by you. Here you find one which writes jsonlines messages to stderr.
    // This can be anything, for example a progress bar (see src/tests.rs for an example of this),
    // a fake reporter which collects events for testing or maybe even a "MultiHandler<'h>" which
    // consists of a Vec<&'h dyn EventHandler> and executes multiple handlers under the hood.
    let handler = JsonHandler::default();

    // This one is included with the library. It just needs to be hooked up with a channel.
    let reporter = ChannelReporter::new(sender, disconnect_receiver);

    // This one is also included with the library. It also needs to be hooked up with a channel.
    // It's EventListener implementation spawns a thread in which event messages will be handled.
    // Events are send to this thread using channels, therefore the name ChannelEventListener âœ¨.
    let listener = ChannelEventListener::new(receiver, disconnect_sender);

    // Here we use the jsonlines handler we defined above, in combination with the default `EventListener`
    // implementation on the `ChannelEventListener` we used above.
    //
    // If we don't run the handler, we'll end up in an infinite loop, because our `reporter.disconnect()`
    // below will block until it receives a Disconnect message.
    // Besides, if we don't run the handler, we would not need this library =). 
    // 
    // Also: as described above, it spawns a thread which handles updates, so it won't block.
    listener.run_handler(handler);

    // These are the events we would call during the regular flow of our program, for example
    // if we use the library in a package manager, before, during or after downloading dependencies.
    // The use any-event-type-you-like nature allows you to go as crazy as you would like. 
    #[allow(unused_must_use)]
    // sending events can fail, but we'll assume they won't for this example
    {
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::text("[status]\t\tOne"));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::event(MyEvent::Increment));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::event(MyEvent::Increment));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::text("[status::before]\tTwo before reset"));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::event(MyEvent::Reset));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::text("[status::after]\t\tTwo after reset"));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::event(MyEvent::Increment));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::event(MyEvent::Increment));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::event(MyEvent::Increment));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::event(MyEvent::Increment));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::event(MyEvent::Increment));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::event(MyEvent::Increment));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::text("[status]\t\tThree"));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::event(MyEvent::Increment));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::event(MyEvent::Increment));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::event(MyEvent::Increment));
        reporter.report_event(ExampleEvent::text("[status]\t\tFour"));
    }

    // Finish handling reported events, then disconnect the channels.
    // If not called, messages which have not been handled by the handler may be discarded. 
    let _ = reporter.disconnect();
}

// ------- Events

// if we would have imported third-party libraries, we could have done: #[derive(serde::Serialize)]
enum ExampleEvent {
    Event(MyEvent),
    Text(String),
}

impl ExampleEvent {
    pub fn event(event: MyEvent) -> Self {
        Self::Event(event)
    }

    pub fn text<T: AsRef<str>>(text: T) -> Self {
        Self::Text(text.as_ref().to_string())
    }
}

impl ExampleEvent {
    // Here we create some json by hand, so you can copy the example without importing other libraries, but you can also
    // replace all of this by, say `serde_json`, and derive a complete json output of your `Event` definition all at once (by designâ„¢ =)).
    pub fn to_json(&self) -> String {
        match self {
            Self::Event(event) => event.to_json(),
            Self::Text(msg) => format!("{{ \"event\" : \"message\", \"value\" : \"{}\" }}", msg),
        }
    }
}

enum MyEvent {
    Increment,
    Reset,
}

impl MyEvent {
    pub fn to_json(&self) -> String {
        match self {
            Self::Increment => format!("{{ \"event\" : \"increment\" }}"),
            Self::Reset => format!("{{ \"event\" : \"reset\" }}"),
        }
    }
}

// ----- A handler

struct JsonHandler {
    stream: Arc<Mutex<Stderr>>,
}

impl Default for JsonHandler {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            stream: Arc::new(Mutex::new(io::stderr())),
        }
    }
}

impl EventHandler for JsonHandler {
    type Event = ExampleEvent;

    fn handle(&self, event: Self::Event) {
        /* simulate some busy work, so we can more easily follow the user output */
        thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1));
        /* simulate some busy work */
        let message = event.to_json();

        let mut out = self.stream.lock().unwrap();
        let _ = writeln!(out, "{}", message);
        let _ = out.flush();
    }

    fn finish(&self) {
        let mut out = self.stream.lock().unwrap();

        let message = format!("{{ \"event\" : \"program-finished\", \"success\" : true }}");

        let _ = writeln!(out, "{}", message);
        let _ = out.flush();
    }
}

```

## Origins

This library is a refined implementation based on an earlier [experiment](https://github.com/foresterre/rust-experiment-air3/blob/main/src/main.rs).
It is intended to be used by, and was developed because of, [cargo-msrv](https://github.com/foresterre/cargo-msrv) 
which has outgrown its current user output implementation.
